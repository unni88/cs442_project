CON-Venient is an Event Management Android Application that could be used to view details
about an event by users.Here the domain that we are mainly dealing with is the Job Fairs or
Conventions that are held year round.This app is mainly targeted towards the attendees of the
events so the details are entered through a web portal which is viewable by the attendees
using our Android App.
Each Time the Attendees sign in to the App the Android Device synchronizes with our web
service and also remembers Attendee Preferences and only show those Events which are of
their interest
